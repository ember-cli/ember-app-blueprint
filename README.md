# @ember/app-blueprint 

This is the blueprint that is used to generate a **new** Ember app using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) as the primary build system.

If you have an existing app that you would like to upgrade to use Vite consider using the [ember-vite-codemod](https://github.com/mainmatter/ember-vite-codemod)

##Â Usage

pnpm dlx ember-cli@latest app my-app-name -b @ember/app-blueprint --pnpm
